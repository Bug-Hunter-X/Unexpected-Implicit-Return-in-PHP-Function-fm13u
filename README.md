# PHP Implicit Return Bug

This repository demonstrates a common, yet subtle, bug in PHP related to implicit returns within conditional statements.  The `bug.php` file contains the problematic code, while `bugSolution.php` provides a corrected version.

The issue arises from the fact that a return statement in an `if` block can unexpectedly terminate the function's execution before other intended code is reached. This is particularly problematic when dealing with functions that handle various conditional states or exceptions.
